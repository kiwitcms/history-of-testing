On September 9, 1947 operators of the Mark II electromechanical computer
traced a malfunction caused by a moth trapped in a relay. This bug was carefully
removed and taped to the log book with the notation
"First actual case of bug being found". This log book, complete with attached
moth, is part of the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American
History. It is often said that this is when the word bug was first used to
describe software errors however this is not accurate because the term "bug" has
been part of engineering jargon for much longer.
