title: Alan Perlis
description: |
    On April 1, 1922 was born Alan Jay Perlis.
    He was an American computer scientist best known for his pioneering work in
    programming languages and was the first recipient of the Turing Award.
    DeMillo, Lipton and Perlis criticized the idea of formal verification of programs and argued that
    formal verifications in computer science will not play the same key role as proofs do in mathematics;
    absence of continuity, the inevitability of change, and the complexity of specification of real programs
    will make formal verification of programs difficult to justify and manage.
