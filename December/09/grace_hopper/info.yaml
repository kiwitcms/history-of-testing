    On December 09, 1906 was born Grace Brewster Murray Hopper.
    She is an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.
    Hopper earned a Ph.D. (1934) in mathematics from Yale and she best known for her trailblazing contributions to computer programming, software development, 
    and the design and implementation of programming languages.
    Hopper is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" and "bug", as during her team work on Harvard Mark II computer, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay 
    and was impeding the operation of the computer. Upon extraction, the insect was affixed to a log sheet for that day with the notation, "First actual case of a bug being found".
