title: Grace Hopper
description: |
    On December 09, 1906 was born Grace Brewster Murray Hopper.
    She is an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral best known for
    her trailblazing contributions to computer programming, software development,
    and the design and implementation of programming languages.
    Hopper developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and
    components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL.
    The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among
    the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s,
    these tests were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards,
    known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
