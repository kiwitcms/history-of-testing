title: Ada Lovelace
description: |
    On December 10, 1815 was born Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace.
    She was an English mathematician
    and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed
    mechanical general-purpose computer.
    The concept that software might contain errors dates back to Ada's 1843 notes
    on the Analytical Engine, in which she speaks of the possibility of program
    *cards* being erroneous.
