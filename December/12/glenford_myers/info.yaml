title: Glenford Myers
description: |
    On December 12, 1946 was born Glenford Myers.
    He is an American computer scientist, entrepreneur, and author.
    In 1979 Glenford introduced the separation of debugging from testing
    in his book The Art of Software Testing.
    Although his attention was on breakage testing, i.e. discovering errors,
    this illustrated the desire of the software engineering community to
    separate fundamental development activities, such as debugging,
    from that of verification.
