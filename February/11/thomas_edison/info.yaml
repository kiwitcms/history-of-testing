    On February 11, 1847 was born Thomas Alva Edison.
    He was an American inventor and businessman.
    Using the term 'bug' to describe a flaw in a system is
    widely attributed to Edison because he used it in a letter
    to Theodore Puskas.
    According to other sources the term bug was already commonly used to
    describe systems faults in Edison's time.
