title: Vilfredo Pareto
description: |
    On July 15, 1848 was born Wilfried Fritz Pareto.
    He was an Italian civil engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher.
    Vilfredo introduced the Pareto Principle which is often interpreted in testing as
    '80% of the bugs are found by only 20% of the test cases' or
    '20% of efforts bring 80% of results'. This often serves as the basis
    of planning test executions and prioritizing resources.
