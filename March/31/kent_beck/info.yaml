title: Kent Beck
description: |
    On March 31, 1961 was born Kent Beck.
    Kent Beck is an American software engineer and the creator of extreme programming,
    a software development methodology that eschews rigid formal specification for a collaborative and iterative design process. 
    Beck was one of the 17 original signatories of the Agile Manifesto, the founding document for agile software development. 
    Extreme and Agile methods are closely associated with Test-Driven Development (TDD), of which Beck is perhaps the leading proponent.
    Beck pioneered software design patterns, as well as the commercial application of Smalltalk. He wrote the SUnit unit testing framework for Smalltalk, 
    which spawned the xUnit series of frameworks, notably JUnit for Java, which Beck wrote with Erich Gamma. 
    Beck popularized CRC cards with Ward Cunningham, the inventor of the wiki.
