title: Kent Beck
description: |
    On March 31, 1961 was born Kent Beck.
    He is an American software engineer and the creator of extreme programming.
    Beck was one of the 17 original signatories of the Agile Manifesto.
    Extreme and Agile methods are closely associated with Test-Driven Development (TDD),
    of which Beck is perhaps the leading proponent.
    He wrote the SUnit unit testing framework for Smalltalk,
    which spawned the xUnit series of frameworks, notably JUnit for Java,
    which Beck wrote with Erich Gamma.
