title: Edsger Dijkstra
description: |
    On May 11, 1930 was born Edsger Dijkstra.
    He was a Dutch pioneer in computing science.
    One of Dijkstra's famous quotes is
    'Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs'.
    He also criticizes the excessive use of the GOTO statement
    because it complicates the task of analyzing and verifying the correctness of programs.
    In his lecture 'The Humble Programmer' Dijkstra states
    'One should not first make the program and then prove its correctness,
    because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the burden'.
