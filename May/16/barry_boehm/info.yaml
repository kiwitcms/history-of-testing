title: Barry Boehm
description: |
    On May 16, 1935 was born Barry Boehm.
     He is an American software engineer, known for his many contributions to the area of software engineering.
    Boehm created the spiral model of software development, in which the phases of development are repeatedly revisited.
    This iterative software development process influenced extreme programming.
    In his paper Software Engineering, published in the December 1976 issue of IEEE Transactions,
    Barry Boehm publishes his cost-of-change curve. The curve essentially shows that the cost of changing the software
    (fixing a software defect) rises exponentially in time.
