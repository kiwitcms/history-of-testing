title: International Software Testing Day
description: |
    On September 9, 1947 operators of the Mark II electromechanical computer
    traced a malfunction caused by a moth trapped in a relay. This bug was carefully
    removed and taped to the log book with the notation
    "First actual case of bug being found". This log book, complete with attached
    moth, is part of the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American
    History.
    Today we celebrate the 9th of September as the International Software Testing day!
